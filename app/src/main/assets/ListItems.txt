Visit Monticello
Monticello was the primary plantation of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, who began designing and building Monticello at age 26 after inheriting land from his father. Located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, in the Piedmont region, the plantation was originally 5,000 acres (20 km2), with Jefferson using slaves for extensive cultivation of tobacco and mixed crops, later shifting from tobacco cultivation to wheat in response to changing markets. In 1987 Monticello was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. (Source: Wikipedia)

Hug Ms. Kathy
Ms. Kathy is the most awesome dining worker at UVa! She can be found at the entrance to Newcomb Dining Hall swiping IDs with an unceasing smile and a propensity for hugs. Someone give her a raise already.

Pick apples at Carter's Mountain
Come to Carter's Mountain for all the overpriced apples you could possibly want that you can also find at your local grocery store. But it's worth it because you're paying for the romanticizing experience of being an orchard picker for all of three hours.

Stargaze on the Lawn
Leave the comfort of your cozy rooms and trek to the Lawn to gaze at stars you can see pretty much anywhere else on this hemisphere. Bonus points if the ground is still wet from the last torrential downpour. Remember, it's all for the ~UVa experience~.
